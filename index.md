# 个人介绍
大家好，我来自中国，在中国上完了小学初中高中和本科，现在正在攻读美国研究生的学位，专业是Computer Science。
在这个页面我将发布一些个人的技术学习心得与一些日常生活感悟，当作一种消遣与放松，请大家多多指教。
我的专业在本科时就是计算机科学与技术，当时选择这个专业时，我的想法和其他很多跟我选择同样专业的同学一样，都是能够学习足够多的知识。
并且在未来的职场竞争中获得一份收益可观的职业回报。

# Self introduction
Hello everyone, I am from China. I have completed elementary, middle school, high school and undergraduate studies in China. I am now studying for a graduate degree in the United States, majoring in Computer Science.
On this page, I will post some personal technical learning experience and some daily life insights, as a kind of pastime and relaxation, please give me your advice.
My major was computer science and technology when I was undergraduate. When I chose this major, my idea was the same as that of many other students who chose the same major as me. They were able to learn enough knowledge.
And get a considerable career return in the future workplace competition.

### 我的技术兴趣方向
我的技术兴趣方向也很广泛，但主要都和我在大学本科期间和读研究生期间接触到的技术相关。
- 1.人工智能与人机交互处理（Artifical Intelligence and Human Computer Interface Design）
- 2.算法与其编程语言实现,也就是刷题哈哈XD(Algotithms and its implemntation through the Programatic Languages)
- 3.网页开发与数据库技术,看看很多前端大佬们的亮瞎钛合金狗眼的炫酷特效我虽然一直在流口水但并不妨碍我企图尝试XD(Web Developement and Databse System)
- 4.游戏开发与虚拟现实（Computer Game Development and Virtual Reality）

### My technical interests
My technical interests are also very broad, but they are mainly related to the technologies I came into contact with during my undergraduate and graduate studies.
- 1. Artifical Intelligence and Human Computer Interface Design
- 2. Algorithm and its programming language implementation, that is, XD (Algotithms and its implemntation through the Programatic Languages)
- 3. Web development and database technology, look at the cool special effects of bright blind titanium alloy dog eyes by many front-end bigwigs. Although I have been drooling, it does not prevent me from trying to try XD (Web Developement and Databse System)
- 4. Computer Game Development and Virtual Reality (Computer Game Development and Virtual Reality)
